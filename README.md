# Automatic Pill Dispenser | Arduino-Based Embedded Systems Project

Designed and built an automatic pill dispensing system using Arduino, integrating both hardware and software for efficient medication management. The system dispenses pills at scheduled times, reducing human error and improving medication adherenceâ€”particularly valuable for the elderly and patients with chronic conditions.

## Key features include:

### Servo motor control: 
Rotates compartments at a desired angle (adjustable based on space constraints) to release pills.

### Real-time interface: 
LCD screen displays current time, live ticking clock, and pill dispensing messages. A buzzer and an LED indicate pill-taking time. 

### System feedback: 
Serial Monitor is used for tracking servo activity and debugging.
